TWO options during development:
01. place all go code in main.go and switch build config from package to file
02. place code in multiple go files but launch from Terminal as go run *.go

Edit configurations
AFTER
Run kind        File
Package path    ~/GitHub/StevePro7/GolangWebApplicationFirewall/*/main.go


Otherwise on the terminal
go build main.go
go run main.go


export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/modsecurity/lib/
go run main.go


IMPORTANT
when change C code must change main.go to ensure that C changes are detected
otherwise they seem to be cached!!
