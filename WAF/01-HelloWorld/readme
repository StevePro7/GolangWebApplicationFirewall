Not sure if can bubble const char* out of C function to Go
but in the interim can return the index of the file that causes error
in reality I have not seen any errors that have occurred loading rules


e.g.
waf.go
// https://groups.google.com/g/golang-nuts/c/H77hcVt3AAI?pli=1
p := C.getString()
s := C.GoString(p)
log.Println(s)
C.free(unsafe.Pointer(p))
defer C.free(unsafe.Pointer(p))

defer C.free(unsafe.Pointer(p)
return err
	
	
waf.h
const char* getString()
{
    const char *error = NULL;
    return error;
}

void getStringX(char *error)
{
    error = "bob";
}
