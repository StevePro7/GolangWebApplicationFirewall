This POC simulates configmap storing large list of CRS filenames
Iterate and store them in C pointer array then can process
msc_rules_add_file(rules, filename, &error);


Could do this in one go but has the clunky passing stringa => C pointer array thing
OR could simply iterate Go slice and call C function to add rule file individually
if did second way then would have to split the Init C function into many functions
